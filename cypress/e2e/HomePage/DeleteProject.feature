  Background:
    Given I clear cache
    And   I set viewport size to '1920' px for width and '1080' px for height
    And   I visit the '/'

    When I click on '[data-cy="create-project-button"]'
    And  I set on '[data-cy="create-project-form"] [data-cy="name-input"]' text 'projectName'
    And  I click on '[data-cy="create-project-form"] [data-cy="submit-button"]'
    And  I wait 1 second
    Then I expect current url is 'projectName/models'

    When I click on '[data-cy="navigation-bar"] [data-cy="home-page-link"]'
    Then I expect current url is '/'

  #Scenario: Delete project should remove it from the projects list
  #  Then I expect '[data-cy="project-card_projectName"]' exists
  #  And  I expect '[data-cy="project-grid-empty"]' not exists
